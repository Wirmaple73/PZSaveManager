## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions
**Q: Is Save Manager compatible with mods? Will it work with existing worlds?** <br>
**A:** Indeed! Save Manager doesn't care about your mods or current world progress. It just stashes copies of your world folder and restores them when needed.

**Q: Can this application modify sandbox settings and save data?** <br>
**A:** Not for now. This app specializes in creating saves and restoring them, not editing save data. There are much better mod alternatives for that.

**Q: Will my worlds get rekt if I delete the app? Will my saves disappear?** <br>
**A:** Nope, Save Manager doesn't self-destruct. Your worlds will be left untouched. Your saves can still be found at `C:\Users\%username%\Zomboid\Backups` (or the custom directory you set before).

**Q: Why is the saving or restoration process relatively slow?** <br>
**A:** While Save Manager *enslaves* multiple CPU cores to speed things up, the worlds themselves have tens of thousands of tiny files, making most operations dependent on disk speed. By default, your saves are stored at `C:\Users\%username%\Zomboid\Backups`. You should override this path to your SSD drive if needed. Moreover, if you enabled save compression, turn it off unless you're low on disk space. These options can all be configured inside the application.

## üìô Common Jargons
* **World:** Also called a *map*. Corresponds to the worlds you create in-game.
* **Save:** Also called a *checkpoint* or *backup*. A world can have multiple saves. In the [preview](#project-zomboid-save-manager) at the top of this README, **Manual save**, **Before testing my new shotgun**, etc. are called *saves*.
* **External save:** Saves manually created by the user in the Save Manager UI.
* **Manual save:** Saves created by pressing the save hotkey in-game (by default: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F5</kbd>).
* **Auto-save:** Saves created by the auto-save function. This function is disabled by default.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues
Although the **manual save** and **auto-save** functions both work perfectly fine, you might sometimes experience some of the following side effects after restoring a save that was created using these functions.

#### The following side effects apply to all game versions:
* Discovered locations on the minimap might temporarily disappear. This can be fixed by simply quitting to the main menu in-game and loading the world again.
* Some nearby 'alive' and recently-killed zombies may be missing in some cases.
* Recently discovered locations may be randomized‚Äîthey might spawn different zombies & vehicles, different vehicle and zone stories, etc. This mostly occurs when you drive to an undiscovered location and immediately save afterward.
* If you save while your car is running, it may be turned off after restoring the save. This behavior exists in vanilla Project Zomboid itself. Don't blame me if you save amidst a horde and your wreck doesn't start in time!

#### The following side effects *only* apply to 41.78.16 (and probably other build 41 versions):
* Your **map annotations** and discovered minimap/worldmap locations may be erased. ‚ö†Ô∏è
* Disabled radios and TVs may sometimes be turned back on.
* Other miscellaneous issues might arise.

#### The following issues *only* apply to Save Manager itself, not related to saves:
* In the save selection page, shortcut keys like <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>N</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd> may or may not work depending on how the program feels like. Use the buttons provided in the tool strip or right-click context menu instead. Only if I could find that lowlife control that's stealing key presses...

These side effects probably happen because prior to writing certain files (e.g. the minimap) to disk, the game sometimes temporarily stores them in memory, which Save Manager doesn't have access to. You are recommended to quit to the main menu in-game and create an **external save** every time you intend to save, *especially on build 41.* **This guarantees that no side effects will show up.**

Regardless, manual save and auto-save are both very reliable in build 42. The issues above are mostly just minor inconveniences.
